# .codex Overview

This folder is the shared project brain for Ain't Got No Body. It is meant to be skimmed quickly by humans and AI to understand the game and continue work without re-discovery.

## How to Use
- Start with `map.md` for orientation, then `slingshot_spec.md` for the core mechanic.
- Record progress and decisions in `journal.md` after every working session.
- Plan work in `todo.md`; keep item IDs stable.
- Update specs and plans when you change behavior, assets, or scope.

## File Index
- `map.md` — repo/scene map and starting points.
- `slingshot_spec.md` — current-state description of the slingshot mechanic.
- `prd.md` — product requirements tailored to this project.
- `design.md` — game loop, level, and narrative guidelines.
- `tech.md` — architecture, systems, and engineering practices.
- `todo.md` — prioritized, acceptance-testable backlog.
- `journal.md` — chronological log of work/decisions/risks.
- `release_plan.md` — milestones, QA bars, and launch readiness.
- `known_issues.md` — bugs/tech debt with reproduction notes.

## Conventions
- Use IDs: `EPIC-###`, `FEAT-###`, `TASK-###`, `BUG-###`, `CHORE-###`.
- Keep entries concise, with repo paths and scene names where relevant.
- Maintain a **Known / Unknown** section in relevant docs to highlight facts vs. open questions.
