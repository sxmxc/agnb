# Feature Inventory

| Feature | Status | Player Value | Evidence | Gaps / Improvements | Ship Impact |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Rotation-based launch with trajectory preview | Implemented | Aim the skull, preview landing arc, and launch for traversal/bounce play. | `scripts/movement/player.gd` applies `jump_force` along rotation with braking and rotation reset; trajectory preview in `scripts/gameplay/trajectory_line_rigidbody.gd`; player scene wiring in `scenes/common/player.tscn`. | No power charge; launch only when grounded; rotation reset mapped to `move_up` not dedicated action; no fast restart/unstick control. | P0 |
| Collectibles (keys, coins, lives) | Implemented | Gathering items increases keys, coins, or lives and updates HUD. | Pickup logic in `scripts/interaction/world_items/key_interactable.gd`; HUD updates via `scenes/common/ui/player_hud.gd`; GameManager counters in `scripts/preloads/game_manager.gd`. | No per-level tally; coins only used for lives at 99; collectibles not saved between runs. | P1 |
| Keyed doors | Implemented | Spend a key to open blocking doors; dialogue feedback when locked. | Interaction in `scripts/interaction/world_items/door_interactable.gd`; door visuals/state in `scripts/gameplay/door.gd`; scene prefab `scenes/common/world_interactables/door_interactable.tscn`. | Single-key requirement hardcoded; no HUD hint about required keys; lock persists only via SaveManager (not wired). | P1 |
| Checkpoints and life system | Implemented | Reaching checkpoints sets respawn; deaths consume lives and respawn the player. | Checkpoint trigger in `scripts/gameplay/player_checkpoint.gd`; death handling in `scripts/gameplay/world.gd` and `scripts/gameplay/death_zone.gd`; counters in `scripts/preloads/game_manager.gd`. | Game over flow unverified; no manual restart button; current checkpoint not shown in UI. | P0 |
| Level-end body goal | Partial | Touching the body goal triggers ending dialogue and score tally. | Event trigger prefab `scenes/common/world_obstacles/body_goal.tscn`; level-end UI in `scenes/common/ui/level_end.gd`; World handling in `scripts/gameplay/world.gd`. | Only present in `world_1/level_2`; `world_2` lacks a goal so progression soft-locks. | P0 |
| Moving platforms & conveyors | Implemented | Platforms move on paths; conveyors impart motion to the skull for traversal puzzles. | Moving platform prefab `scenes/common/world_obstacles/moving_platform.tscn` with `scripts/gameplay/moving_platform.gd`; conveyor prefab `scenes/common/world_obstacles/conveyor.tscn` with linear velocity. | Limited variation; no safety rails; conveyors not surfaced in HUD/tutorial. | P2 |
| Dialogue interactables (tutorial mouse) | Implemented | NPC speech pauses the timer and provides tutorial text. | Tutorial mouse prefab `scenes/common/world_interactables/tutorial_mouse.tscn` using `scripts/interaction/dialog/speech_interactable.gd`; camera handoff via PhantomCamera. | Dialogue uses `GameManager.current_sidecar` (never set), risking null references for timer pause/resume. | P0 |
| Camera triggers & minimap | Partial | Camera triggers reposition camera and minimap shows level. | Camera targeting in `scripts/camera/camera_trigger_targeter.gd`; camera areas in `scripts/camera/camera_area.gd`; minimap viewport nodes in world scenes. | No anticipation zoom; trigger coverage per level unverified; shake/limits not configurable in UI. | P1 |
| HUD, pause, timer, and scoring | Implemented | HUD shows keys/lives/coins and timer; pause menu toggles pause; level-end screen tallies score. | HUD logic in `scenes/common/ui/player_hud.gd` and timer `scripts/gameplay/level_timer.gd`; pause menu in `scripts/ui/pause_menu.gd`; level-end UI in `scenes/common/ui/level_end.gd`. | Timer/score read `GameManager.current_sidecar` (unset); no restart button; HUD lacks trajectory/angle hinting. | P0 |
| Save/Load & settings | Partial | Settings sliders adjust volumes and can be saved; SaveManager exists for persistence. | Settings UI `scripts/ui/settings_control.gd`; SaveManager autoload script `scripts/utilities/save_manager.gd`; save/load buttons in menu (`scenes/menus/main_menu.tscn`). | SaveManager not wired into flow; load/save buttons likely no-op; no confirmation of persisted collectibles/progress. | P1 |
